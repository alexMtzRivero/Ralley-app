# QRallyeApp
Mobile application for a ralley contestant

This Project was required by the civil engineering faculty of the Grenoble Alpes University which required an application to conduct a ralley-type contest
## Description
A ralley is an individual or team race in which the participants must complete a specific tour with stations, in each station a challenge is presented, the fastest members to complete all the challenges correctly and reach the goal will be the winners.

The purpose of this application is to serve as an intermediary for a ralley player

The application has a map that shows the position of the questionnaires created by the administrators in the web administrator, the mobile app has real time geo location  to carry out a progress check of the equipment.

Once found, through the application, the QR code is scanned displaying the corresponding questionnaire in the app, once answered, a new position on the map is displayed on the main map to explore and the process is repeated.

A very important quality of this project is the possibility of recovering the session in the state in which it was left from any Android device.

It has a crash recovery system that will, even when the application and all its data is erased, return to the state in which the app was when the system crashed.
